    title: 'AI Fundamentals',
    shortDescription: 'Learn the core concepts and principles that form the foundation of artificial intelligence.',
    content: [
      'Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, language translation, and problem-solving.',
      'The foundation of AI rests on several key concepts: machine learning, which enables systems to learn from experience; knowledge representation, which allows machines to understand and store information; and algorithmic problem-solving, which helps machines find solutions to complex problems.',
      'Modern AI systems use various approaches, from rule-based systems to deep learning, to achieve their goals. While early AI focused on logic and rules, today\'s AI primarily uses data-driven approaches, learning patterns from vast amounts of information to make predictions and decisions.',
      'Understanding AI fundamentals is crucial as these technologies become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, from smartphone assistants to autonomous vehicles.'

    shortDescription: 'Explore how LLMs like GPT are transforming natural language processing and AI capabilities.',
    content: [
      'Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. These models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), have revolutionized natural language processing.',
      'LLMs work by processing text through multiple layers of attention mechanisms, learning patterns in language at various levels - from basic grammar to complex reasoning. They can perform a wide range of tasks, including writing, translation, coding, and answering questions.',
      'Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have limitations and challenges. They can sometimes generate incorrect information, exhibit biases present in their training data, and lack true understanding of the content they process. Understanding these limitations is crucial for responsible use of these technologies.',
      'The development of LLMs continues to advance rapidly, with improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and capabilities, making them increasingly valuable tools in various applications.'

    shortDescription: 'Understand how artificial neural networks simulate brain function to solve complex problems.',
    content: [
      'Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in human brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process and transmit information, enabling machines to recognize patterns and solve complex problems.',
      'The basic structure includes input layers, hidden layers, and output layers. Each connection between neurons has a weight that adjusts during training, allowing the network to learn from examples. This process, known as deep learning when many layers are involved, has revolutionized AI capabilities.',
      'Neural networks excel at tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and even game playing. Their ability to learn and adapt makes them powerful tools for handling complex, real-world problems where traditional programming approaches fall short.',
      'Recent advances in neural network architectures, combined with increased computing power and data availability, have led to breakthrough achievements in AI, from self-driving cars to medical diagnosis systems.'

    title: 'AI Ethics & Bias',
    shortDescription: 'Examine the ethical considerations and challenges of AI development and deployment.',
    content: [
      'AI ethics encompasses the moral principles and guidelines that govern the development and use of artificial intelligence systems. As AI becomes more prevalent in society, understanding and addressing ethical concerns becomes increasingly crucial.',
      'One major concern is algorithmic bias, where AI systems reflect or amplify existing societal biases present in their training data. This can lead to unfair treatment in areas like hiring, lending, and criminal justice. Recognizing and mitigating these biases is essential for developing fair and equitable AI systems.',
      'Privacy and transparency are other critical ethical considerations. AI systems often require vast amounts of data, raising questions about data collection, consent, and usage. Additionally, the "black box" nature of some AI algorithms makes it difficult to understand how they reach their decisions.',
      'As AI continues to evolve, establishing clear ethical frameworks and guidelines becomes vital for ensuring these technologies benefit society while minimizing potential harm.'
